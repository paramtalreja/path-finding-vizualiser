Developed a path visualizer utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to illustrate the shortest route between a source and a destination. This project enables users to visualize the path in real-time. It incorporates algorithms such as Dijkstra's and Breadth-First Search. Additionally, it features an interactive user interface that allows adjustment of speed and array size.
